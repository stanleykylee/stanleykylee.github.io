<p>Continuing on the theme of Virtualization, I tried to maintain our VMs via vSphere 4, however I quickly found that vSphere will not run on Windows 7 still! Seems like we need to update to the latest patch with a newer version of the vSphere client. I'll have to wait another day before I can test and verify this though. Onward to more W7 problems!</p>
