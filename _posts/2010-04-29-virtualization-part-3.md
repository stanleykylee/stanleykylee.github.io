<p>To finish this journey, I will conclude that we have decided to not upgrade the servers at this point in time. There was really not much changes that we found useful or beneficial at all. So I just downloaded the latest files from VMware and installed the latest vSphere 4 directly from those files.Â It worked right away after that.</p>
<p>So the lesson of the day is... have the latest and greatest!</p>
