<p>Here's a fun tip! I just found out today by chance that Google's Chrome browser will do automatic site searching! If the site you are viewing has a search functionality, all you have to do is type the <em>domain.com</em> follow it by a space and the item you want to search! It will automatically direct you to the search function with your search in the query string! Neat!</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>shopbot.ca core i5</code></p>
<p>pointed me directly to:</p>
<p><code>http://www.shopbot.ca/m/?m=core+i5</code></p>
<p>Neat little trick... once again, hope this helps and have fun!</p>
